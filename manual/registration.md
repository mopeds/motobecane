# Registration

## Vermont

You do not need to be a resident of Vermont or ever step foot in Vermont to register a vehicle in Vermont through the mail. Vermont has great laws for registering older vehicles (no title needed after 15 years), is cheap, and is easier than other states. You send an envelope with a check and you get back a license plate within 1 month.

In an envelope, include:

- [Registration Application VD-119](http://dmv.vermont.gov/sites/dmv/files/documents/VD-119-Vehicle_Reg_Tax_Title_App.pdf)
  - Top section:
    - Circle "Owned"
    - Use your address in Owner/Lessee
    - In "VT License" put "SSN: (your social)"
      - If you don't have a social security number, just put your out of state license # instead
  - Middle section:
    - Circle "New Registration"
    - "Registration/Plate Type" write "motor driven cycle" in the left-hand space and "17" in the right-hand space
  - Bottom section:
    - "Body Type" write MDC
    - "Serial Number" write your VIN
    - "Cylinders" write 1
    - Circle "Used"
    - Circle "Gas"
    - "Cycle/ATV" write "2" in # of wheels, "49" in CCs
    - "Purchase price" write "500"
    - "Net taxable" write "500"
    - "Registration" write "30"
    - "Tax" write "30"
- [Bill of Sale VT-05](http://dmv.vermont.gov/sites/dmv/files/documents/VT-005-Bill_Of_Sale_Odometer_Cert_0.pdf)
  - Make sure you use the same info for the Bill of Sale as what is written in 5B on your VD-119
- Three photos of your bike
  - A close up of the VIN plate on the front fork
  - A photo of the VIN plate on the bike
  - A photo of the whole bike
- A check for $60
  - Minimum taxable amount is $500, so $30 for registration and $30 tax on $500 totaling $60

Mail it to:

```
Vermont Department of Motor Vehicles
120 State Street
Montpelier, Vermont 05603
```

And you're done!

## New York

Registering in New York is time consuming, annoying, and likely will take multiple attempts to find a sane DMV employee.

Things you need for the DMV:

- Decide which moped class you want to register as
  - Class C is most laid back - 20mph or under
  - Class B you need a helmet and insurance - 20 to 30mph
  - Class A you need a motorcycle license, helmet, and insurance - 30 to 40mph
- [Registration Application MV-82](https://dmv.ny.gov/forms/mv82.pdf)
- [Statement of Transaction DTF-802](https://dmv.ny.gov/forms/dtf802.pdf)
- [Statement of Ownership For Non-Titled Vehicles MV-51B](https://dmv.ny.gov/forms/mv51b.pdf)
- [Certificate of Sale For Non-Titled Vehicles MV-51](https://dmv.ny.gov/forms/mv51.pdf)
- [Bill of Sale MV-912](https://dmv.ny.gov/forms/mv912.pdf)
- Drivers License
- Three photos of your bike
  - A close up of the VIN plate on the front fork
  - A photo of the VIN plate on the bike
  - A photo of the whole bike

Tell them the moped has never been registered, if you state it has a lost title then they will try to go through a system that takes months.

Key points to stick to if questioned: It's a moped, 20mph or under if registering as Class C (make sure to stick to the number you have written), it has never been registered, it's a Class C moped, it only has 49 cc's, and the notarized bill of sale is usually the deal maker.

If you have a stubborn DMV clerk just try again the next day.

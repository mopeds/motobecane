The [Kryptonite 48' Keeper lock](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00WE0A0JA) should be plenty of security for anyone living in the city, and conveniently fits under a long seat for a little extra convenience.

If you are willing to spend a little extra, the [Kryptonite New York Fahgettaboudit lock](https://www.amazon.com/Kryptonite-York-Fahgettaboudit-Bicycle-Chain/dp/B001SMUB7G) will keep your bike secured - and still fits under your seat for convenient locking.

##### Tips

- If you do decide to use the under-the-long-seat lock method, make sure your seat is secured by various long bolts with locknuts to make it an hours long process to remove.

Simple, cheap, waterproof. Has a hole for a lock, and comes with a wide end for your handles. The [Ohuhu waterproof bicycle cover](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B018Q6RML4) is the perfect size for a Motobecane 50 or 40.

##### Tips

- Be careful while you're pulling it over the bike - sharp points like your license plate, ends of brake cables, or mirrors can cut a hole right through your cover.

### Mirrors

Most bicycle mirrors will lose their rigidity over time and become useless. A good set of mirrors should retain rigidity over time, have a wide field of view, and not get in your way. These [adjustable 8" chrome mirrors](https://www.treatland.tv/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=chrome-adjustable-8in-mirror) strike a nice balance of being useful and not getting in your way - plus they look really nice and have a good classic look to them.

##### Tips

- If the vibrations of your bike make it hard to see out of your mirror, you can put a piece of rubber hose between the.
- If you find that the mirror to handlebar attachment is loosening up over time, you can use [red loctite](https://www.amazon.com/Loctite-Threadlocker-Red-0-20-209741/dp/B000FP8EUS) to keep them in place.

Don't want your headlight to get broken by a flying rock? Or maybe you just want your bike to look like. Either way, this [universal chrome grill](https://www.treatland.tv/universal-moped-chrome-headlight-grill-p/moped-grill-chrome.htm) is a cheap and easy way to spruce up your bike.

##### Tips

- While installing, you'll have to bend the mounts slightly to get it around a stock motobecane headlamp.

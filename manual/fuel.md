## What to Buy

- [Oil measuring cup](https://www.amazon.com/Pit-Posse-PP3240-2-Stroke-Measuring/dp/B0088NYRRI)
- [2.5gal fuel dispenser](https://www.amazon.com/No-Spill-Gas-Can-2-5-Gallon/dp/B009HP2UDY/)
- [1 gallon of semi-synthetic smokeless 2 stroke oil](https://www.amazon.com/Lucas-Oil-10115-Semi-Synthetic-2-Cycle/dp/B0002KKTWC)

## Oil

- Only use oil meant for 2 strokes, or you're going to ruin your bike.
- Never run your bike without oil or it will overheat and blow up.
- Never run your bike with too much oil, or it will "run rich" (use too much fuel, foul spark plugs quickly, run poorly).

## Ratio

Using modern synthetic oils, the ratio for mopeds is 50:1 - for every 50 parts gas, have 1 part oil. For 2.5 gallons of gas, you would put 6.4oz of oil in (2.5 gallons / 50 = 6.4oz).

## Mixing

- Measure oil and pour it into an empty gas container
- Go to the gas station and fill it up (remember to properly match the amount of oil you put in)
- Close the cap and shake the crap out of it
- All done!

## Emergency Situations

Most Motobecane tanks (50, 40 models) are 0.75 gallons. If you find yourself on the side of the road and your tank is completely empty, you can do the following:

- Walk it to a gas station
- Go inside and grab a small bottle of 2 stroke oil
- Fill your tank up **almost all the way** with gas (you need to leave enough room for the oil)
- Eyeball measure 1.92oz of oil and pour it in
- Put your bike on the center stand and shake the crap out of it so the oil and gas mix properly
- All done!
